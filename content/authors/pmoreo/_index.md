## Short bio

I am a computer engineer from the University of Granada. I finished my master's degree in Computer Architecture and Technology in 2009, specializing in CUDA programming of NVIDIA cards for general purpose processes with high parallelization capacity to increase performance.

I was a Unity3d teacher in several schools in Barcelona between 2016 and 2018 and recently joined the IFMIF-DONES project to work in virtual reality.

## Research interests

I am interested in the development of games for virtual reality. I also believe that this type of applications can have a lot of medical applications in the future in the development of certain therapies.
