abstract: "An efficient workflow has been developed to generate virtual reality simulations of the maintenance tasks requiring remote handling in DONES (a particle accelerator facility). This framework focuses on the communication between different engineering teams and outlines a Virtualization Task Documentation, which organizes all the necessary information needed to create the simulation. Moreover, this workflow includes a node-based design tool that allows effective translation from natural-language description of the maintenance tasks and actions into virtual reality simulations. The efficiency of the workflow and usefulness of the resulting simulations was demonstrated in a specific use case, the replacement of the high-energy beam transport scraper in the accelerator system in DONES. The simulation of the whole replacement process has been generated. The presented workflow has also been useful for the simulation of maintenance procedures in other areas of the same facility, proving to be easy to adapt to other processes."
