abstract: "DONES is planned to operate on a continuous basis with only two beam stop periods per year for maintenance. The planned operational availability is 70 %, which calls for a carefully analyzed preventive maintenance. The purpose of the research is to propose a realistic and comprehensive logistics and maintenance plan. All the maintenance activities are included in a Maintenance Matrix based on the Plant Breakdown Structure of the project. This is the basis for the creation of a maintenance plan that will lead to a Work Schedule. Special mention within this matrix will be given to those Maintenance operations that must be included in order to comply with regulation. The need of replacement of components impose some requirements on the dimensions of architectural features of the main building such as doors, airlocks, corridors and shipping bays. To enable these replacements, the flow of materials has been developed and analyzed by an intralogistics simulation with AnyLogic. The results of this simulation lead to modifications on either the building or the components such that the replacements are feasible. The periodic replacement of an activated component has been analyzed using FMEA methodology resulting in proposals for the plant equipment designers as well as the remote handling equipment designers. Virtual reality simulations are used for a staged approach to the maintenance operation. The simulation of the HEBT scraper helped to define in detail each step or the maintenance operation. This tool has proven to be very useful to prompt changes in both the plant equipment design and the remote handling equipment. Also, the procedure of the operation itself can be refined and optimized. The conclusion of the research activities is the contribution to the definition of the building, plant equipment and achievement of the target availability."
